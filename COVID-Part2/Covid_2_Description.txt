This COVID-Part2 is a subpart of the CovidPandemic_DataMining repository.
These data exploration, mining and visualization are done as per the blog created by Orange Data Mining.
(Link: https://orange.biolab.si/blog/2020/2020-04-09-covid-19-part-2/)
It contains the following files:
i) The Covid_2 Orange Data Mining Workflow
	Part(i): To understand GeoMap and Choropleth Map functionality.
	Part(ii): To manipulate data with reference to different attributes and use time slicing tool to create a resultant data table from which the GeoMap and Chloropleth Map can be visualized as changing with time on a day-to-day basis from the starting date in the data to the current day scenario.
ii) Resultant data table from data manipulation.
iii) The sample GeoMap and Choropleth Map images.
iv) The video imagery created due to time slicing (date wise) to understand the nature of COVID-19 spread in different countries as days progress (disease progression on GeoMap and Choropleth Map).
